## Ideas
- always show menu for current tile
  - use arrow keys to navigate tiles
  - use wasd keys to navigate menu
  - use enter to select tile?
  - use space to select menu option
- more of a 'vibe' kind of game than one you win or point based
  - a lot of the time there will be no one in the store to help, you can spend this time working on the store, placing orders, etc..
- instead of needing to get every item for every customer, customers can see and select their own grocery list except for the things they need help with
